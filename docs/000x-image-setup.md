# Image setup

use nextjs image component with a custom loader:
Either no optimization or via the plugin
outlined in herehttps://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/19065


ignore the nextjs/no-image-element rule
optimize images via custom script.
maybe even do a webp variant.
do hashing myself or just via custom names.


At the moment the second variant does mostly appeal to me, because there is no
nextjs build dependency.
So there are no boundaries when nextjs ships new features where we have to wait until a library brings support as well.
